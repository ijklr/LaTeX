\textbf{FACT 7.} Let $X$ be a Tychonoff space. If $X$ is locally compact, then $X$ can be condensed onto a compact space.

\textbf{Proof.} Let $X\cap \{\infty\}$ be the one-point compactification of $X$. Pick any $x_0\in X$. Let $K$ be the space $X\cup \{\infty\}$, where the point $\infty$ is identified with the point $x_0$. In $K$, the open sets containing $x_0$ is of the form $U_{x_0} \cup V_{\infty},$ where $U_{x_0}$ is any open set containing $x_0$ in $X$, and $V_\infty$ is any open set containing $\infty$ in $X\times \{\infty\}.$ For $x\in K\backslash \{x_0\},$ the open sets containing $x$ in $K$ are same as the ones containing $x$ in $X$.

$K$ compact with the topology we've just defined. Let $f:X\times K$ be the identity map. So, $f$ is one-to-one and onto. Let $U_{x_0}\cup V_\infty$ be an open set containing $f(x_0)=x_0,$ then $U_{x_0}$ is an open set in $X$ such that
$f\left[U_{x_0}\right]=U_{x_0}\subset U_{x_0}\cup V_\infty.$  So $f$ is continuous on $x_0$, as well as on other points of $X$.
